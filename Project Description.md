# Superstore-Profit-Prediction

The goal of this project is to predict the profit for a Superstore Giant based on its four-year transaction data, and explore influential factors that contribute to the business. By utilizing large-scale transaction data, sponsored by Kaggle, of 9,994 respondents in 49 states across the U.S, our research team was able to develop regression models to predict margin and generate key insights to support the strategy-making process. We processed 7 different regression models and found the Gradient Boosting model best fitted the data with a high R squared(0.83) and low RMSE(83.93). 

Based on our Gradient Boosting model, we generated some insights from the relatively important variables: sales, discount and Subcategory. We recommend the store to implement seasonal discount, invest in Tech-Oriented Products, and reduce budget on low-return product subcategories - Table, Bookcase, etc.
